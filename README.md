# ShipStation to aftership
I was sick of manually doing a CSV export from Shipstation, formatting it, then uploading it to AfterShip so I make this small PHP script to do it for me using the API of each platform.

If you want this to just work out of the box, you just need your api keys for both sites. There are two variables to set right near the top.

For more information on getting your keys, check out the links below.
